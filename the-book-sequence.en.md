# Why write this book

Actually, I first got into Python when I was in college. Although it was less than a year ago, I still remember choosing a graduation design topic. When I saw the theme of Python Based Collector, it struck me at that time, and I made up my mind to choose this topic. It so happened that my classmates came to find out if I wanted to choose this topic as my graduation design. They hit it off right off and started to study Python.

In fact, before writing this book, my heart struggled for a long time, always feel that they do not have the ability to write a book, because their understanding is relatively simple, some things need to be repeated to understand more deeply, but until recently I heard my high school classmates said, there is a high school classmate has published their own novels, and I have a special respect for those who write articles, write books.

In fact, I always have a wish is to hope that they can publish a book of their own, this is what I have been driving, this book is a record of their zero-based learning from Python to reptile practice process.

I hope I can write this book bit by bit, day by day, and slowly sort out the previous articles. No one limits me and no one encourages me. It's just my own creation.
